# Hipstagram

During development, I have used to React, Redux-Saga, Type Script, GraphQL query, and functional component.

**Demo**: [hipstagram.com](http://hipstagram.com)

**#Hipstagram** - is a new and unique social network where you can discover a lot of new things. You can add your photos and comments. Share jokes with colleagues and friends.

We also differ favorably from our competitors in that you can view not small photos as on Instagram, but open the photo in full screen and see all the pleasures of life that have happened to you.

Do not be shy and come in soon. Open to a new world with Hipstagram!
